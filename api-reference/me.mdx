## Response Breakdown

| Field | Type | What it tells you |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| `name` | string | Any custom label you've set for this key (useful for managing multiple integrations). |
| `tier` | string | Either `free`, `pro`, or `enterprise`. |
| `rate_limit` | string | Your hard cap limits (e.g., `300/min`). |
| `websocket` | boolean | True if you have access to the `/ws/alerts` live stream. |
| `webhooks` | boolean | True if you can register HTTP endpoints for push delivery. |
| `realtime` | boolean | True if you get alerts instantly, False if you have the 5-minute Free tier delay. |
| `max_page_size` | integer | Max results you can request per page on the `/alerts` REST endpoint. |
| `requests_today` | integer | Total API calls you've made since UTC midnight. |

<Tip>
Building a front-end? Hit this endpoint on page load to check if the user's provided API key is valid before opening any WebSocket connections.
