Every request needs an API key in the `Authorization` header.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Get a key

DM [@alrerat](https://t.me/alrerat) on Telegram. Tell us what you're building and we'll set you up with the right tier.

## Try it

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer pc_your_key_here" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/me
```

```python Python
import requests

r = requests.get(
    "https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/me",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer pc_your_key_here"}
)
print(r.json())
```

```javascript JavaScript
const r = await fetch("https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/me", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
});
const data = await r.json();
```

</CodeGroup>

If your key is valid, you'll get back your tier info and usage stats.

## Key format

Keys start with `pc_` followed by a random string:

```
pc_Kr_Ohzog-pwKB64HmOk7uGf-Q86Zde5kpyD1F2IVDzA
```

<Warning>
Keys can't be recovered after creation. Store them somewhere safe. Don't commit them to public repos.
