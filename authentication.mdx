title: Authentication
description: Secure your requests and manage your tier limits.

We keep authentication simple. Every request just needs your API key passed in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## How to get a key

We've split our key generation to make sure you get exactly what you need, instantly.

### 1. Free & Pro Keys (Automated)
If you just want to start building, analyzing data, or testing your bots, use our automated Telegram integration.

<Card title="Get a Free or Pro Key" icon="robot" href="https://t.me/chadsapibot">
  Open **@chadsapibot** → Tap **Get API Key** → Join the channel → Pick your tier. 
  
  *Your key is generated and ready to use immediately.*
</Card>

### 2. Enterprise Keys (Manual)
If you're running a production system that requires webhook push delivery, entirely unlimited rate limits, and dedicated support, you need an Enterprise key.

<Card title="Request Enterprise Access" icon="briefcase" href="https://t.me/alrerat">
  DM **@alrerat** directly on Telegram. Tell us what you're building, your expected volume, and we'll provision a custom key for your backend.

## Compare Tiers

| Feature | Free | Pro (30 Days) | Enterprise |
|--|------|---------------|------------|
| **Data Freshness** | 5-minute delay | **Real-time** | **Real-time** |
| **Pulls per minute** | 60 | 300 | **Unlimited** |
| **WebSocket Stream** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Webhook Delivery** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

<Tip>
Pro keys are completely free for the first 30 days. When it expires, your key will automatically downgrade to the Free tier, so your integration won't completely break — it'll just get rate-limited and delayed formatting.

## Test Your Key

Want to make sure everything is working? Hit the `/me` endpoint. It'll bounce back your exact tier features and how much of your rate limit you've chewed through today.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/me
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/me",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE"}
)
print(response.json())
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/me", {
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE" }
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

## Security

Keys follow this format: `pc_` followed by a high-entropy random string.
Example: `pc_Kr_Ohzog-pwKB64HmOk7uGf-Q86Zde5kpyD1F2IVDzA`

<Warning>
**Treat your key like a password.** We hash these in our database, meaning if you lose it, we cannot recover it for you. Never commit your key to a public GitHub repository or expose it in client-side frontend code.
</Warning>
