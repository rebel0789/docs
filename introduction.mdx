description: Polymarket insider alert intelligence — real-time detection, delivered via API
---

## What we do

We watch **every trade on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com)** and flag the suspicious ones — fresh wallets dropping thousands on a single outcome, wallets accumulating positions across multiple buys, and clusters of new wallets all betting the same way within minutes.

When we spot it, you get an alert — with the wallet, the market, the trade size, the price, and a **signal score** telling you how likely it is to be insider activity.

  <Card title="Real-Time Detection" icon="bolt">
    Alerts hit your app the moment we detect suspicious activity. WebSocket streaming for zero-latency delivery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Signal Scoring" icon="crosshairs">
    Every alert gets a 0–100 score based on wallet age, trade size, timing patterns, and accumulation behavior.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Context" icon="chart-bar">
    Wallet history, accumulation patterns, entry prices, market odds, cluster analysis — everything you need to act.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple Integration" icon="plug">
    REST for historical data, WebSocket for live, webhooks for push. JSON in, JSON out. Works with anything.
