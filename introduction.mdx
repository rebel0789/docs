description: Polymarket insider alert intelligence — delivered via API

## What we do

We watch every trade on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) and flag the suspicious ones. Fresh wallets dropping $5K on a single outcome. Wallets accumulating positions across multiple buys. Clusters of new wallets all betting the same way within minutes.

When we spot it, you get an alert — with the wallet, the market, the size, the price, and a signal score telling you how likely it is to be insider activity.
