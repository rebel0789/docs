## What we do

We watch **every single trade on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com)** so you don't have to. 

When a brand new wallet drops $10k on a niche political outcome? We see it. When five different fresh wallets start accumulating positions on the same market within minutes of each other? We catch that too. 

The moment we detect suspicious or highly-convicted trading behavior, we fire off an alert. You get the wallet address, the market details, the trade size, the exact entry price, and a proprietary **Signal Score** that tells you exactly how likely it is to be insider activity.

    We don't do delays (unless you're on the free tier). If you need the alpha *now*, our WebSocket stream delivers alerts milliseconds after the trade confirms on-chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Signal Scoring" icon="crosshairs">
    We rank every alert from 0 to 100. We look at wallet age, historical win rate, trade size relative to the pool, and coordination patterns to separate the noise from the signal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full On-Chain Context" icon="chart-bar">
    We give you the full picture. You'll know if a wallet is aggressively accumulating, if they're part of a larger cluster, and exactly what their average entry price is.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built for Builders" icon="plug">
    REST APIs for pulling historical data. WebSockets for live streaming. Webhooks for enterprise push delivery. It's just JSON — plug it into whatever you're building.
