Let's cut the fluff and get you connected. Follow these four steps and you'll be pulling live Polymarket alpha in less than a minute.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab an API Key">
    Head over to **[@chadsapibot](https://t.me/chadsapibot)** on Telegram. Tap *Get API Key*, join our community channel, and select your tier. 
    
    You'll be handed a key that looks like `pc_Kr_Ohz...`. Copy it.
    
    <Tip>Grab the Pro tier. It's free for 30 days and gives you real-time data and WebSocket access. Free tier has a mandatory 5-minute delay on all alerts.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify your connection">
    Let's make sure the key works and check your limits. Drop this into your terminal:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
      https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/me
    ```

    If it works, you'll get back a JSON payload showing your exact tier, what features are unlocked, and your daily request count.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pull the latest alpha">
    Time for the good stuff. Let's pull the 5 most recent insider alerts our engine detected.

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
      "https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/alerts/latest?limit=5"
    ```

    You're now looking at raw insider action — the wallet address, the market they bet on, exactly how much USDC they dropped, and our AI Signal Score rating the trade's suspiciousness.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optional: See what's trending (Hot Markets)">
    Want to know where the coordinated money is flowing right now? Hit the Hot Markets endpoint to see markets ranked by alert volume and signal strength.

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
      "https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/hot-markets?period=24h"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go fully Real-Time (Pro/Enterprise Only)">
    Polling is slow. If you want alerts the literal millisecond we detect them, hook into our WebSocket stream. 

    ```javascript
    const ws = new WebSocket(
      "wss://polychadsbot.xyz/ws/alerts?api_key=YOUR_KEY_HERE"
    );

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
      
      // We only care about the actual alert payloads
      if (msg.type === "alert") {
        const data = msg.data;
        console.log(`🚨 INSIDER ALERT: ${data.event_title}`);
        console.log(`Action: ${data.side} ${data.outcome}`);
        console.log(`Size: $${data.usdc_value} @ ${data.entry_price}¢`);
        console.log(`Signal Score: ${data.signal_score}/100`);
      }
    };

    // Don't forget your keep-alive ping!
    setInterval(() => {
      if (ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) ws.send("ping");
    }, 25000);
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
