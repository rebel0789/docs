description: Receive alerts via HTTP POST to your server

<Info>
**Webhooks require Enterprise tier.** [Contact us](https://t.me/polychads) to upgrade.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. Register a webhook URL with optional filters
2. When a matching alert fires, we send a `POST` request to your URL
3. Your server responds with `200` to acknowledge receipt

## Create a Webhook

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook/polychads",
    "categories": "crypto,world",
    "min_signal": 40
  }' \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks
```

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | string | ✅ | Your HTTPS endpoint URL |
| `categories` | string | ❌ | Comma-separated category filter |
| `min_signal` | integer | ❌ | Minimum signal score (0-100) |

### Response

```json 201
{
  "id": 1,
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook/polychads",
  "categories": "crypto,world",
  "min_signal": 40,
  "created_at": "2026-02-27T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## List Webhooks

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks
```

## Delete a Webhook

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks/1
```

## Webhook Payload

Your endpoint receives a `POST` with the full [Alert object](/reference/alert-object) as the JSON body:

```json
{
  "id": 2221,
  "alert_type": "fresh",
  "side": "BUY",
  "outcome": "Yes",
  "entry_price": 0.42,
  "usdc_value": 2100.0,
  "signal_score": 72,
  "event_title": "Will ETH hit $5000 by April?",
  "category": "crypto",
  "created_at": "2026-02-27 12:00:15"
}
```

<Tip>
Respond with a `200` status code within 5 seconds to acknowledge receipt. Failed deliveries are not retried.
