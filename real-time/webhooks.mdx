title: Webhooks
openapi: POST /webhooks
description: We push alerts to your servers immediately. No polling required.

<Note>
Webhooks are strictly for **Enterprise** infrastructure. If you're running a massive deployment and need guaranteed HTTP delivery rather than maintaining WebSocket state, DM **[@alrerat](https://t.me/alrerat)** to set up a massive custom limit.
</Note>

## How the Webhook System Works

You register a specific URL endpoint with us. The millisecond an alert passes your customized criteria, we blast a `POST` payload containing the complete alert JSON straight to your server.

**Your only job:** Respond with a generic `200 OK` status code within 5 seconds to tell us you received it. (Failed deliveries are not retried, to prevent backing up the queue).

## Create a Webhook

Register your endpoint and tell us exactly what kind of alerts you want us to send.

<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-production-app.com/api/polychads-hook",
    "categories": "crypto,world",
    "min_signal": 80
  }' \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks
```

</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>

```json 200 OK
{
  "id": "hook_8812jka...",
  "url": "https://your-production-app.com/api/polychads-hook"
}
```

</ResponseExample>

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | Yes | Your secure HTTPS endpoint. We do not support unencrypted HTTP delivery. |
| `categories` | No | Comma-separated list of genres you care about. If omitted, we ping you for everything. |
| `min_signal` | No | Only send alerts with a Signal Score (0-100) equal to or above this number. Perfect for noise reduction. |

## The Payload Structure

When an alert fires, we will hit your `url` with a `POST` request. The body will be the standard [Alert Object](/reference/alert-object) formatted as JSON:

```json What lands on your server
{
  "id": 2221,
  "alert_type": "fresh",
  "side": "BUY",
  "outcome": "Yes",
  "entry_price": 0.42,
  "usdc_value": 2100.0,
  "signal_score": 72,
  "event_title": "Will ETH hit $5000 by April?",
  "category": "crypto",
  "created_at": "2026-02-27 12:00:15"
}
```

## Manage Existing Webhooks

### List All Webhooks
See exactly what hooks are active on your current Enterprise key.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks
```

### Delete a Webhook
Taking down a server? Clean up your hook so we stop hitting an empty endpoint.

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY_HERE" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}
```
