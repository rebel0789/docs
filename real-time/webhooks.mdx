## How it works

Register a URL. When an alert matches your filters, we POST it to your endpoint. You respond `200` to confirm receipt.

## Create

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
    "categories": "crypto,world",
    "min_signal": 40
  }' \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | Yes | Your HTTPS endpoint |
| `categories` | No | Comma-separated filter |
| `min_signal` | No | Minimum signal score |

## List

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks
```

## Delete

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks/1
```

## Payload

Your endpoint receives the full [Alert object](/reference/alert-object) as JSON:

```json
{
  "id": 2221,
  "alert_type": "fresh",
  "side": "BUY",
  "outcome": "Yes",
  "entry_price": 0.42,
  "usdc_value": 2100.0,
  "signal_score": 72,
  "event_title": "Will ETH hit $5000 by April?",
  "category": "crypto",
  "created_at": "2026-02-27 12:00:15"
}
```

Respond with `200` within 5 seconds. Failed deliveries are not retried.
