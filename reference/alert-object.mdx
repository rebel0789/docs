## Alert types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="fresh — Brand new wallet">
    A wallet with little or no history making a significant trade. Fresh wallets are the strongest insider signal because they're often created specifically to avoid detection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="fresh_accumulator — Repeat buyer">
    A fresh wallet making multiple buys on the same market. Shows conviction. The `details` object includes:

    ```json
    {
      "is_accumulating": true,
      "market_buy_count": 4,
      "market_total_bought": 6200.0,
      "market_avg_price": 0.31
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="cluster — Coordinated group">
    Multiple wallets buying the same outcome within a short window. Suggests coordination.

    ```json
    {
      "cluster_size": 5,
      "cluster_total_usdc": 12500.0,
      "cluster_wallets": ["0x1...", "0x2...", "0x3..."]
    }
    ```
