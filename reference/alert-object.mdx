## Alert Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="fresh — New wallet alert">
    A brand-new or very low-activity wallet making a significant trade. These are the highest-signal alerts because insiders often create fresh wallets to avoid detection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="fresh_accumulator — Repeat buyer">
    A fresh wallet that has made **multiple buys** on the same market — showing conviction. The `details` object includes accumulation data:

    ```json
    {
      "is_accumulating": true,
      "market_buy_count": 4,
      "market_total_bought": 6200.0,
      "market_avg_price": 0.31
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="cluster — Coordinated group">
    Multiple wallets buying the same outcome within a short timeframe. Indicates possible coordination. The `details` includes cluster info:

    ```json
    {
      "cluster_size": 5,
      "cluster_total_usdc": 12500.0,
      "cluster_wallets": ["0x1...", "0x2...", "0x3...", "0x4...", "0x5..."]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
