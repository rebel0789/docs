title: The Alert Object
description: Understand exactly what we're handing you when we catch a whale.
---

Whether you're hitting the REST APIs (`/alerts`, `/hot-markets`) or listening to the live WebSocket stream, every single alert you receive follows this exact JSON structure.

## Core Fields

| Field | Type | What it tells you |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | integer | Our internal unique tracking ID. |
| `alert_type` | string | `fresh`, `fresh_accumulator`, or `cluster`. (See below). |
| `wallet_address` | string | The literal on-chain address of the trader. |
| `market_id` | string | The Polymarket contract address for this specific market. |
| `event_slug` | string | The URL-friendly name of the market. |
| `event_title` | string | The actual human-readable market question. |
| `side` | string | Always `BUY` or `SELL`. |
| `outcome` | string | What they bet on (`Yes`, `No`, or a specific multi-choice name). |
| `entry_price` | float | The price they paid per share (0.01 – 0.99). |
| `usdc_value` | float | Exactly how much USDC they deployed on this specific trade. |
| `signal_score` | integer | Our AI rating from 0–100 measuring the likelihood of insider knowledge. |
| `trade_count` | integer | How many different markets this wallet has historically traded. |
| `category` | string | e.g., `crypto`, `politics`, `world`. |
| `created_at` | string | UTC timestamp of when we detected the trade. |

### Resolution Fields
These fields are populated only after the market has officially resolved on Polymarket. While the market is live, they remain `null` or `false`.

| Field | Type | What it tells you |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `resolved` | boolean | True if the market has officially closed and paid out. |
| `won` | boolean | True if this specific alerted trade ended up taking profit. |
| `profit_usdc` | float | The net P&L realized by the trader. |

## Alert Types Breakdown

We classify insider activity into three distinct buckets, and inject specific tracking data into the `details` object depending on what we see.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="fresh — The Ghost Protocol">
    A brand new wallet with zero or near-zero history suddenly drops heavy volume on a specific outcome. These are the strongest raw insider signals because wallets are often funded exclusively to execute this one trade without tying back to a main identity.
    
    ```json The Details Object
    {
      "wallet_age_days": 0
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="fresh_accumulator — The High Conviction Buyer">
    A fresh wallet that isn't just buying once — they are repeatedly smashing the buy button on the exact same market over time. This shows extreme conviction.

    ```json The Details Object
    {
      "wallet_age_days": 2,
      "is_accumulating": true,
      "market_buy_count": 4,          // How many separate buys they've executed
      "market_total_bought": 6200.0,  // Total USDC deployed across all buys
      "market_avg_price": 0.31        // Their blended average entry price
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="cluster — The Coordinated Strike">
    We detect multiple completely separate wallets all buying the exact same outcome within a very tight time window. Highly indicative of coordinated groups or single actors using distributed wallets.

    ```json The Details Object
    {
      "cluster_size": 5,              // How many wallets moved together
      "cluster_total_usdc": 12500.0,  // The combined volume of the strike
      "cluster_wallets": [            // The addresses involved
        "0x1abc...", 
        "0x2def...", 
        "0x3ghi..."
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
