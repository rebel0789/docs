### REST API

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/alerts?category=crypto"
```

### Webhooks

When creating a webhook, specify categories as a comma-separated string:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://...", "categories": "crypto,politics"}' \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/webhooks

<Note>
Categories are assigned automatically using keyword analysis on the event title and slug. New alerts are categorized in real-time.
