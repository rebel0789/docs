| `crypto` | Token FDV, blockchain events, DeFi |
| `world` | Geopolitics, conflicts, international events |
| `politics` | Elections, policy, nominations |
| `pop_culture` | Celebrities, entertainment, media |
| `tech` | AI, Apple, Tesla, SpaceX |
| `finance` | Stocks, rates, S&P 500 |
| `other` | Everything else |

## Filtering

### REST

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/alerts?category=crypto"
```

### Webhooks

Pass categories as a comma-separated string when creating a webhook:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-app.com/hook",
  "categories": "crypto,politics"
}
```

Categories are assigned automatically by keyword analysis on the market title. Happens in real-time for new alerts.
