title: Rate Limits
description: Request limits per API key
---

Limits use a 1-minute sliding window per key.

| Tier | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Free | 60/min |
| Pro | 300/min |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

## When you hit the limit

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60

{"detail": "Rate limit exceeded. pro tier: 300 req/min."}
```

## Check your usage

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  https://polychadsbot.xyz/api/v1/me
```

The `requests_today` field shows your daily count.

## Tips

- Use WebSocket instead of polling for real-time data
- Cache responses where possible
- Back off exponentially on `429`
- Use webhooks for event-driven architectures
