description: What the signal score means
---

Every alert gets a score from 0 to 100. Higher = more likely to be insider activity.

## Ranges

| Score | Level | What it means |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **80–100** | 🔥 Very High | Fresh wallet, big size, precise timing. Likely insider. |
| **60–79** | ⚠️ Strong | Clear accumulation or notable fresh entry. Worth watching. |
| **40–59** | 📊 Moderate | Interesting but could be a savvy trader. |
| **0–39** | ℹ️ Low | Large trade from a known wallet. Informational. |

## What goes into the score

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Wallet age** | Newer = higher. Wallets created days before a big bet are suspicious. |
| **Trade history** | Fewer past trades = higher. One-market wallets stand out. |
| **Position size** | Bigger USDC = higher. Small probes score lower. |
| **Entry timing** | Buying at extreme odds right before a move scores high. |
