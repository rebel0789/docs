title: Signal Score
description: How alert quality is scored for insider likelihood
---

Every alert is scored **0-100** based on multiple factors. Higher scores indicate stronger insider signals.

## Score Ranges

| Range | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **80-100** | 🔥 Very High | Likely insider — fresh wallet, precision timing, large size |
| **60-79** | ⚠️ Strong | Clear accumulation pattern or notable fresh entry |
| **40-59** | 📊 Moderate | Interesting activity, could be experienced traders |
| **0-39** | ℹ️ Low | Informational — large trades from known wallets |

## Scoring Factors

The signal score is calculated from:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Wallet Age" icon="clock">
    Newer wallets score higher. Fresh wallets created within days of trading are the strongest signal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trade History" icon="chart-line">
    Fewer previous trades = higher score. One-market wallets are suspicious.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Position Size" icon="dollar-sign">
    Larger USDC positions increase the score. Small "test" trades score lower.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Price Timing" icon="crosshairs">
    Buying at extreme odds (very low or very high) when the market later moves significantly.
